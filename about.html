  <p>Hey! My name is Koree Arndt. I’m a rising senior passionate about music and performance. As a dedicated member of the Brownsburg Marching Band, I’ve had the honor of reaching the Grand National Finals twice—performing “Uninvited” in 2022 and “Pipe Dreams” in 2023.</p>
  
  <p>In addition, I perform with the Brownsburg Winter Percussion, where we were finalists in the WGI World Class 2024 with the show “Curated.”</p>
  
  <p>I have also performed multiple ISSMA state solos, earning perfect scores, and was selected for the All-State Orchestra in Indiana as a sophomore and the All-State Band in Arkansas as a junior. This year, I’m excited to perform at the Midwest Music Clinic with the wind ensemble!.</p>
